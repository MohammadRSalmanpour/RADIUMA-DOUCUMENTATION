Overview
========

ViSERA is a Python-based desktop software designed to improve usability, reusability, and reproducibility in medical imaging and healthcare research. As a major, entirely-revamped upgrade to the original SERA (MATLAB-based), ViSERA enables standardized and reproducible radiomic feature extraction in compliance with the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI 1.0).

The platform employs numerous popular image processing algorithms to create end-to-end standardized workflows, making it an ideal development platform for reproducible research by connecting different tools. 

Development Background
---------------------

This software has been developed by the Quantitative Radiomolecular Imaging and Therapy (Qurit) lab & program (www.qurit.ca), at the BC Cancer Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in collaboration with the Technological Virtual Collaboration (TECVICO CORP., www.tecvico.com).

Software-driven innovation plays a critical role in shaping novel research directions, particularly in medical imaging. This field brings together diverse imaging technology trends, including image visualization, conversion, registration, fusion, filtration, segmentation, and information extraction, all of which demand versatile and effective user interfaces.

ViSERA's radiomic feature calculations remain meticulously consistent with SERA and IBSI 1.0, while also being standardized against IBSI 2.0. The software has been validated for various filter options, ensuring reliability and reproducibility.

Target Users
-----------

One of ViSERA's standout features is its flexibility in handling multiple image formats, regardless of resolution, orientation, or imaging modality. This capability, combined with its user-friendly design, makes ViSERA accessible to researchers of all skill levels, including radiation oncologists, radiologists, physicists, and computer and data scientists. The intuitive initialization and connection of different algorithms enable researchers to pursue individual or collaborative medical imaging research with ease.
