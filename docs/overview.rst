Overview
========

ViSERA is a Python-based desktop software designed to improve usability, reusability, and reproducibility in medical imaging and healthcare research. As a major, entirely-revamped upgrade to the original SERA (MATLAB-based), ViSERA enables standardized and reproducible radiomic feature extraction in compliance with the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI 1.0).

The platform employs numerous popular image processing algorithms to create end-to-end standardized workflows, making it an ideal development platform for reproducible research by connecting different tools.
